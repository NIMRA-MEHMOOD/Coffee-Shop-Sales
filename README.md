# Coffee-Shop-Sales
The coffee shop sales dashboard is a visual summary of key business metrics, displaying total sales, customer footfall, average bill per person, and average orders per person. It includes charts that illustrate order quantities by hour, sales distribution across product categories, and the popularity of different order sizes. The dashboard also compares footfall and sales across multiple store locations and highlights the top-selling products. Additionally, it shows order trends throughout the week, providing a comprehensive view of sales performance and customer behavior in the coffee shop.
